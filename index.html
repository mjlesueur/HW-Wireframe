<!--
    Things I bungled as far as I can see:
    -the font isn't correct
    -the background color isn't correct
    -the different attributes of h1 and p relative to section arent apparent
    -my footer width of 94.6% surely isn't the technically correct way to code it.
    -div/something with h1 and p is off. this seemed to make the p not bold.
    -i don't understand/know some of the functions we seem to need for this assignment.
    I'm sure there's plenty more ;)
